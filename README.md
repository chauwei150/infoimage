# interview Charles Lee

First, I can not use my company's VMware to do this exercise because my company 

strictly limit anybody provision any VM in production servers. We have more than 

1000+ users use our VMware daily.

So, I provision two VMs by using my own AWS account.

still,I assign this two VM with IP 10.10.10.9, and the other is 10.10.10.10

Both use ubuntu 24.4 in the 10.10.10.0/24 can be considered in VLAN 10

in each directory

in the README.md

you can see the steps to run each task and its output.
